<p>goa has different "squads" and squad leaders</p>
<p>if you have right to choose wich squad you want to be in</p>
<p>whenever you choose a squad you want to be in</p>
<p>there will be a squad leader who will help you do your homework and many different things</p>
<p>and by the way squad leader atleast has a 2-3 years of coding experience</p>
<p>and if your squad leader isnt available then you can contact different squad leaders or students</p>
<p>and thay will help you out</p>
