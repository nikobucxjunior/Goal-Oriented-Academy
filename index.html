    <p">
    Programming refers to a technological process for
    telling a computer which tasks to perform in  order
    to solve problems. You can think of programming 
    as a collaboration between humans and computers,
    in which humans create instructions for a computer
    to follow (code) ina  language computers can understand.

     Programming languages are a set of instructions provided
     to amachine and converted to machine-readable code.
     In this case, high-level programming languages
     use an interpreter to translate the code,
     while low-level languages use an assembler.

        Computer programmers use programming software to write code.
        Programming software and programming tools enable developers to
        develop, write, test and debug other software programs.
        Examples of programming software include:assemblers, compilers,
        debuggers and interpreters.
